# SMAC – A short messaging application
_chatApp for Weebly_

# Creating a user name: 

If the user_name is already taken, it will prompt that it is taken. 

Once a user_name is selected on page refresh that user will be deleted as it is equivalent to IRC chatting.

Once a room is created, user need to select the room from below drop down list.

Zero in the room name “Batcave (0)”, indicates number of users currently active in that room, the value increases / decreases as users join or leave the room.

# Chat view: 

Once a room is selected, chat view appears with three main divisions.

# Room Chat:

All the messages from different users and messages from current user will be displayed here. 
Once a message is popped up it is differentiated between current user and all other users in the group as you see above. 
Every other user in the group will be intimated when ever a new user join’s the room. 
Send buttons are disabled until there’s something written in the chat text area. 
Text auto scrolls up when there’s a new chat appended at the bottom.

When a user leaves either by selecting another room or going out of the application (either by refreshing their page or closing the app) the room and the private chat will be informed. 

User will be removed from Other Users list too and private chat if opened? Will be closed too. 

# Other Users:

(This is what it looks from Alfred screen)

All other users in the application will be listed and a personal chat can be initiated by clicking on the user. 

When a user name is selected, concerned private chat starts between current user and clicked username. 

The Other Users list is reordered as current active private chat comes first and all other will be listed below this is confined only to users who have initiated the private chat. 

When a user logout of the application, the user_name will be removed from Other Users and if any private chat is opened? That will be closed too. 

Private chat will bring the chat history of the users i.e., 
Say User 1, User 2, User 3 and User 4 are in the application when User 1 had initiated private chat with User 4 and also with User 3 then, when User 4 is selected (Again) the chat history (in the current session) between User 1 and User 4 will be brought back. 

It is similar to what we see in Messenger or any other chat application. 


Thanks!
